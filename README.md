# shallowpy

Shallowpy is shallow water model with full nonlinear capabilities. The model is
intended for educational purposes e.g. to be used by students or to prepare course material.
Therefore, whenever appropriate, simplicity is given a stronger weight than
numerical accuracy or efficiency.

## Installation

Check the required python modules by looking into one of the ci/requirements files.
Install those module e.g. by conda. 

## Running the model

Check out one of the Jupyter Notebooks in `notebooks`. Each notebook has a jupytext synced
python script. Either run one of the notebooks or the python script to get started.
One good example is e.g. `notebooks/geostrophic_adjustment.ipynb`.

The `examp_*.py` can be used but will most likely not be maintained anymore.
